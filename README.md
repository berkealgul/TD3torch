# TD3torch
Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) implementation in Pytorch

[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477v3.pdf)

TD3 is great for problems with continuous action space such as robot control. We trained our implementation in OpenAI gym bipedal walker environment with good results
