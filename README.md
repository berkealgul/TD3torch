# TD3torch
Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) implementation in Pytorch
[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477v3.pdf)

TD3 is great for problems with continuous action such as robot control we trained our implementation in OpenAI gym bipedal walker environnment with good results
